# OpenCV-Color-Drawing-Application-Using-Python
A simple yet interactive Paint Application developed using Python and OpenCV. It enables users to draw using Pen, Eraser, and Shape tools (Rectangle, Circle, Line) with adjustable color and thickness. The project highlights OpenCV’s GUI functionalities, mouse event handling, and trackbar controls.

# 🎨 Mini Paint Application using Python & OpenCV 🖌

🚀 *Project Overview:*
This project is a *Mini Paint Application* built entirely using *Python and OpenCV*, designed to simulate a simple drawing interface similar to MS Paint — directly from your terminal window!
It was a great hands-on project to explore *OpenCV GUI functions, **mouse event handling, **trackbars, and **drawing shapes interactively*.

## ✨ Features

✔ *Freehand Drawing (Pen Mode)* – Draw freely with adjustable color and brush thickness.
✔ *Eraser Tool* – Erase mistakes effortlessly.
✔ *Shape Tools* – Create *Rectangle, Circle, and Line* shapes with live preview.
✔ *Color Customization* – Choose any color using RGB trackbars.
✔ *Adjustable Brush Thickness* – Control the drawing stroke size in real time.
✔ *Save & Clear Options* – Save your creations or clear the canvas instantly.
✔ *Keyboard Shortcuts* – Smooth workflow control.
